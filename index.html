              <h2><b>Eulogy (read by Rick Baumgartner)</b></h2></br>
              <p>Today we remember the remarkable life of my dad Earl Melville Baumgartner. He was born in Collegeville, PA, on November 17, 1934, to Charles and Maud Baumgartner. He shared many wonderful memories with his older sister Dorthy and younger sister Evelyn. Growing up on Germantown Pike, Dad's childhood was filled with lots of family, farm activities, and a strong Pennsylvania Dutch heritage. </p>
              <p>His educational journey took him to Philadelphia Academy, Shenandoah Valley Academy, and finally Temple University. Cars, roller skating, and owning an airplane defined Dad's youth. From racing a Dodge with triple duces to doing the two-step backwards on skates, Dad loved to have fun.</p>
              <p>He had a strong work ethic that emerged early. His first job was swatting flies in Uncle Powell’s dairy, later he paid for his parents' driveway to be paved by the age of 13. In his career he worked as a devoted heating, ventilation, and airconditioning teacher at Montgomery County’s Technical High School for over 30 years.</p>
              <p>Dad's life was marked by moments where his guardian angel worked overtime—from a severe childhood accident to a perilous fall from a roof as an adult. Dad proved resilient, and God allowed him to walk again giving him energy and health for a full life of service.</p>
              <p>Dad believed in service to others. He embraced projects like building the Adventist Community Services Center. He participated in two mission trips himself, and supported many youth to attend mission trips. Dad was a lifelong Pathfinder, known as “The Cotton Candy Man” and “Mr. Pathfinder” to many.</p>
              <p>Dad moved several times, making new memories in each place. From Rahns to Ridge Pike, then finally moving to Mt. Kirk Avenue. Each home held its unique memories, including — encounters with pet raccoons in Nana's garage, litters of kittens on the Mile Hill, and many renovations with necessary breaks to drink chocolate milk.</p>
              <p>With endless energy, Dad loved working in the yard, planting azaleas and saplings on his four acre home on Mt. Kirk Avenue. He delighted in heading out on camping and canoeing trips each season with Blue Mountain Academy, Huntingdon Valley Christian Academy, and local church groups.</p>
              <p>Dad served in the Fairview Village and Lansdale Seventh-day Adventist churches. In the youth Sabbath School, he enjoyed creating quizzes and games to keep his kids engaged and learning. He enthusiastically served as Elder for many years and especially enjoyed giving Bible studies and taking communion to shut-ins.</p>
              <p>As we bid farewell to Dad, let us remember a man who navigated life with resilience, humor, and an unyielding commitment to his Lord and Savior. May his legacy inspire us to think positively in the face of adversity, serve those around us, and point others to the King of Kings.</p>

        <h1>Earl<br>Melville<br>Baumgartner</h1>
        <h2>NOVEMBER 17, 1934 - NOVEMBER 16, 2023</h2>
        <p>Earl Melville Baumgartner, born on November 17, 1934 to Charles Baumgartner and Maud (Lord) Baumgartner. A dedicated pillar of his community, he peacefully passed away on November 16, 2023. Earl leaves behind a legacy defined by his unwavering commitment to Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) youth ministries. He played an impactful role as the director of the Valley Forge Pathfinder club and area coordinator for Southeast Pennsylvania Pathfinders. He dedicated his time and expertise to Huntington Valley Christian Academy, serving on the school board and as a volunteer at Blue Mountain Academy.</p>
        <p>Born and raised in Collegeville, Earl served in the United States Army beginning in 1957 and received an honorable discharge in 1959.</p>
        <p>A lifetime member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Earl was a founding member of the Adventist Community Services Center in Fairview Village, chairing the board and leaving an indelible mark on those he served. Beyond his contributions to the church, Earl loved people and nature; he found joy in camping, canoeing, and gardening.</p>
        <p>For over 30 years, Earl worked as a devoted heating ventilation and air conditioning teacher at Central Montgomery County Technical High School, influencing the lives of countless students. His passion for education extended to his own family, where he imparted wisdom and values to his four children, Rick, Brenda, Ken, and Renee.</p>
        <p>Earl is survived by his beloved wife, Kay (Lantz) Baumgartner, two sisters, Dorothy Workman and Evelyn Thume, four children, five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. His memory will forever be cherished by those who had the privilege of knowing him.</p>
        <p>A memorial service to celebrate Earl's life will be held at Lansdale Seventh-day Adventist Church, on Sunday, December 17, 2023 at 2:00pm. In lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests donations to the “Adventist Community Services Center” or the “Benevolence” fund options on the <a href="https://adventistgiving.org/donate/ANBIHL">Landsdale SDA church donation website</a>. Checks may be made out to Lansdale Seventh-day Adventist Church and mailed to 887 Troxel Rd. Lansdale, PA 19446 with either option on the memo line.</p>
        <p>May Earl rest in peace and his legacy of service live on in the hearts of those he touched.</p>
