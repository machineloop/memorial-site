        <h1>Earl<br>Melville<br>Baumgartner</h1>
        <h2>NOVEMBER 17, 1934 - NOVEMBER 16, 2023</h2>
        <p>Earl Melville Baumgartner, born on November 17, 1934 to Charles Baumgartner and Maud (Lord) Baumgartner. A dedicated pillar of his community, he peacefully passed away on November 16, 2023. Earl leaves behind a legacy defined by his unwavering commitment to Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) youth ministries. He played an impactful role as the director of the Valley Forge Pathfinder club and area coordinator for Southeast Pennsylvania Pathfinders. He dedicated his time and expertise to Huntington Valley Christian Academy, serving on the school board and as a volunteer at Blue Mountain Academy.</p>
        <p>Born and raised in Collegeville, Earl served in the United States Army beginning in 1957 and received an honorable discharge in 1959.</p>
        <p>A lifetime member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Earl was a founding member of the Adventist Community Services Center in Fairview Village, chairing the board and leaving an indelible mark on those he served. Beyond his contributions to the church, Earl loved people and nature; he found joy in camping, canoeing, and gardening.</p>
        <p>For over 30 years, Earl worked as a devoted heating ventilation and air conditioning teacher at Central Montgomery County Technical High School, influencing the lives of countless students. His passion for education extended to his own family, where he imparted wisdom and values to his four children, Rick, Brenda, Ken, and Renee.</p>
        <p>Earl is survived by his beloved wife, Kay (Lantz) Baumgartner, two sisters, Dorothy Workman and Evelyn Thume, four children, five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. His memory will forever be cherished by those who had the privilege of knowing him.</p>
        <p>A memorial service to celebrate Earl's life will be held at Lansdale Seventh-day Adventist Church, on Sunday, December 17, 2023 at 2:00pm. In lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests donations to the “Adventist Community Services Center” or the “Benevolence” fund options on the Landsdale SDA church donation website: https://adventistgiving.org/donate/ANBIHL . Checks may be made out to Lansdale Seventh-day Adventist Church and mailed to 887 Troxel Rd. Lansdale, PA 19446 with either option on the memo line.</p>
        <p>May Earl rest in peace and his legacy of service live on in the hearts of those he touched.</p>
